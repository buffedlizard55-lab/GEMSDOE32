# Standing project prompt — as recorded by the Round-6 session (2026-10-26)

*Preserved from the README of commit `15a5fce` (PR #18), where a parallel session recorded the owner's 2026-10-25 prompt and labelled it verbatim. A later review (PR #21, `docs/research/standing-brief-20261025.md`) cautions that earlier 'verbatim' labels were not reliable, so completeness is **unverified**. The conversation remains authoritative. Read this together with the README's standing brief at the start of every session.*

> ### 📋 STANDING PROJECT PROMPT (Verbatim — read every session as the starting brief)
>
> Review the repo. 
> 
> I want to focus on  the highest scoring submissions from the following sites, GEMSDOE24, GEMSDOE25, GEMSDOE27, GEMSDOE28, GEMSDOE30, GEMSDOE31, GEMSDOE32, GEMSDOE33, GEMSDOE36.
> 
> THE FOLLOWING IS THE HIGHEST URGENCY AND MUST BE FOLLOWED!
> 
> MUST GENERATE A UNIQUE TIF SUBMISSION FOR THE COMPETITION.  DO NOT COPY A PREVIOUS SUBMISSION UNLESS IT'S FOR LEARNING AND EDUCATION.  BUT WE MUST GENERATE A UNIQUE TIF SUBMISSION.  IT MUST BE OBVIOUS WHETHER IT IS OK TO DOWNLOAD AND SUBMIT THE GENERATED TIF SUBMISSION.
> 
> There should be an easy to download submission tif file as described by the prompt.  Read the entire prompt.  A lot of sites mention inspection only and a human inspector, but the inspection needs to be done through the project and needs to be validated for submission without human intervention.
> 
> PARALLEL-RUN PROTOCOL — read first. This session is one of several running from this same prompt.
> 
> 1. LANE. Your lane is the single method paragraph below. Stay inside it. If your raster's rank-correlation with any registry raster exceeds [0.90], or more than [70%] of your dots fall within 3 px of one registry raster's dots, you have drifted into another lane: log it as a duplicate and stop. Check this on the surface before placement AND on the final dots.
> 
> 2. REUSE, DON'T REBUILD. Use the template's cached feature stack, evaluate_holdout.py and submission_writer.py. Holdout = hide-and-recover: withhold whole fault segments with a buffer, derive every catalogue-based feature only from the visible faults, mask visible faults pixel-exactly, score pooled DTI (alpha 0.2, beta 0.8, 300 m triangular kernel). If a shared tool is wrong, fix it once in the template and report it; never keep a private fork.
> 
> 3. LABEL EVERY NUMBER as HOLDOUT-DTI (evaluator version, number of withheld positives, 95% CI) or ORGANIZER-CONFIRMED (copied from a submission-page receipt). A projection is never written as a score.
> 
> 4. LEAKAGE CANARY. Test each feature alone on the holdout before trusting any result. AUC above [0.90] means leakage until proven otherwise.
> 
> 5. RUN CARD. End with one JSON card: hypothesis; mechanism; the named non-fault process that could mimic it; holdout DTI + CI; correlation/overlap vs registry; raster sha256; validator output (no NaN inside the footprint, values in [0,1], CRS/shape/transform match); submission name + note of at most 140 characters; verdict promote / negative. Negative results are deliverables.
> 
> 6. BUDGET. Stop after [3] experiments or [2] hours. Do not pick submissions: promotion to a real slot is a separate selector step, within the weekly cap shown on the submission page.
> 
> The following sites should serve as a starting point for understanding how to generate TIF submissions...
> 
> WE NEED TO STUDY, ANALYZE, AND UNDERSTAND THE HIGHEST SCORE FROM THE GEMDOE SITE WHERE THE SUBMISSION TIF IS DOWNLOADED FROM WHICH IS THE FOLLOWING:
> https://buffedlizard55-lab.github.io/GEMSDOE32/docs/index.html
> h33-h33-2-b2-20261004T220000Z-e5eb6e7e-zeros: 0.2778
> 
> Why and how did this get the highest score and are we able to generate a submission that scores higher than 0.2778?
> Answer the question using Phd level experience, knowledge, and judgement. Then use the answer to generate a unique TIF submission into the competition.  Must be unique submission unlike any within the GEMSDOE sites above.  Verify working line by line no hallucinations.
> 
> Current competition leaderboard GEMSDOE high score: 0.4413
> 
> Before implementing, generate 3–5 candidate geological hypotheses we haven't tried yet, each naming: the specific layer(s) involved, the physical signature being targeted (e.g., an edge-detection or curvature transform), why it should catch a fault missing from the USGS/INGENIOUS catalogue rather than one already in it, and how it differs from anything already implemented in this repo. Rank them by expected DTI improvement and implementation cost. Validate the top candidate on our spatially-blocked holdout set before touching a weekly submission slot — do not spend a submission slot on an idea that hasn't beaten the current holdout best. If a candidate can't be validated without new external data, name the specific free, official source needed and check it's obtainable before proposing the idea as viable.
> 
> Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources, provide links for manual review.  There should be no manual input, work on your own to complete tasks.  Flag any irregularities for review.  No hallucinations.
> 
> I tried to submit the document that i downloaded from the site but it returned this error on the submission form: "Predicted values must be in range [0, 1]"
> Also we need to give it a unique name and A short comment to help you or your team tell submissions apart later e.g. clustering with k=25
> Create a executive summary subpage that explains exactly how to make a submission into the contest.
> Create a github page for this repo that has clean ui, user friendly, simple and easy to use.  It should be organized and clean.
> The single remaining blocker to training is data placement: run `bash scripts/download_competition_data.sh` on any unrestricted machine into `data/`, then `python scripts/prepare_data.py` — after that the full train→inference→validate pipeline is ready to run.
